# Assets directory
The assets directory hosts files via the assets.service.tonbridgespiritualist.com webdir. This allows for centralised management of stylesheets and other static files which allow updates to be rolled out simultaneously across multiple live services at once and remove the need to make updates to multiple stylesheets to create a uniform look.
## Current services live on assets
